ðŸ’ˆ The Vintage Barbershop â€” Static One-Page Website
This is a fully responsive, single-page landing site for a barbershop called The Vintage Barbershop ðŸ’ˆ. It's built with HTML and Tailwind CSS via CDN â€” no frameworks, no build tools, no extra setup.

The goal is to provide a clean and modern layout where customers can:

Discover individual barbers and their services

See pricing for each service

Book appointments through Calendly (card required)

Get answers to common questions

Find shop contact info and location

âœ… Whatâ€™s Included
This index.html file contains:

Hero Section â€“ Shop name, tagline, and a call-to-action

Contact Section â€“ Address, phone number, and Google Map

FAQ Section â€“ Common questions with collapsible answers

Barbers Section â€“ Grid layout for 10 barber cards (using placeholder content)

About Section â€“ Optional shop story or intro

Footer â€“ Basic links and copyright

ðŸ›  Tech Used

Tailwind CSS (CDN via <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com">)

Responsive layout with no external dependencies

ðŸš§ Status
This is a static placeholder version â€” real content (like barber names, images, and Calendly links) will be added later. For now, the layout is styled and structured to simulate a working product visually.
